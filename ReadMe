The folder data_mining contains:
1. two Jupyter Notebook files Recommendation.ipynb and Prediction.ipynb
2. two csv files movies.csv and training.csv which are Serendipity 2018 dataset files.
3. two csv files TrainingDf.csv and TestingDf.csv which were generated while running Prediction.ipynb

To run the source code files:
1. install Anaconda3 > open Jupyter Notebook > go to code folder location and 
2. open the code file to view the code and results.
Or run the code cell by cell to execute the code.

Recommendation.ipynb -- It contains the code which recommends the top N similar movies for a given movie.
Prediction.ipynb -- It contains the code for K-means Clustering and prediction of a movie for the test set users.
{This file generates TrainingDf.csv and Testing.csv if the compute variable in the cell(In [22]) is set to True or
 else it uses the ones which are generated when i have run the code.}

Before running the files change the folder paths of csv files to the location in your local machine/system.
